## 3. Strict Autonomous Engineering Rules

1. **Geography Folder Isolation**: All Geography notes, MCQs, toposheets, maps, or chapter-specific interactive theory vaults MUST reside strictly inside `geography/` and its dedicated subfolders (`climate/`, `soil/`, `vegetation/`, `water/`, `transport/`, `notes/`, `mcq/`, `toposheet/`, etc.).
2. **Standard File Structure for Engines**: Each interactive chapter vault is named `index.html` inside its respective folder (e.g. `geography/<topic>/index.html`) so it can be served as a clean standalone web app or embedded smoothly inside the main dashboard iframe.
3. **Always Include Navigation & Fonts**: Every chapter engine `index.html` MUST include:
   - Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Outfit`, `JetBrains Mono`) and `Material Symbols Outlined`.
   - The `.home-nav-btn` linking back to `../../index.html` with `target="_top"` so students can easily return to the dashboard.
4. **No Empty Subject Folders**: Do NOT create empty directories for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, etc., until the user provides actual files for them. Currently, ONLY Geography has content.
5. **No Root Clutter**: Never leave raw download files (like `gemini-code-*.html` or `temp_*.html`) in the root directory. Process them into their proper folder (`geography/...`) and remove the loose download file immediately.
6. **Leave Video Downloader Untouched**: The `Video_Downloader/` directory is for a completely different utility. Never modify, delete, or commit changes inside `Video_Downloader/`.
7. **Always Synchronize `data.js` and `data.json`**: When adding a new item or chapter, update both files in parallel. `data.js` attaches to `window.COURSE_DATA` for offline `file://` usage, while `data.json` is for standard HTTP fetching.
8. **Git Push Protocol**: Always commit changes and use `BypassSandbox: true` for `git push origin main` because sandbox restricts network access.
9. **Sidebar Navigation Stability**: Keep `.nav-menu` with `overflow-x: hidden !important;`, `overscroll-behavior: contain;`, and `padding-bottom: 24px;`. Prevent any hover `translateX` on `.nav-item` / `.nav-item-featured` that triggers horizontal scrollbars or boundary oscillation loops. Both `.logo-area` and `.sidebar-footer` must have `flex-shrink: 0;`.

## 5. Protocol for Future Chats (Step-by-Step Onboarding Guide)

When the user provides a new `gemini-code-*.html` file or notes PDF in any future chat:
1. **Analyze First**: Check what subject and chapter is provided.
2. **Move from Downloads to Workspace**: Use `BypassSandbox: true` with PowerShell to copy `..\gemini-code-*.html` to `geography/<chapter>/index.html` (e.g. `water/`, `minerals/`, `energy/`, `agriculture/`, `industries/`, `waste/`).
3. **Enhance the File**:
   - Add Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Outfit`, `JetBrains Mono`) and `Material Symbols Outlined` in `<head>`.
   - Add the `.home-nav-btn` in `<header class="command-bar">` linking to `../../index.html` with `target="_top"`.
   - Remove any temporary files from the workspace root.
4. **Wire Data**:
   - Update `data.js` and `data.json` under the respective chapter in `sub-10-geo` with the new interactive theory DPP master item.
   - Update `script.js` to add a quick-launch shortcut with an icon and `NEW` badge in `renderNav()`.
5. **Test in Browser**: Launch `browser_subagent` to verify navigation, modes, timer, and drawer rendering.
6. **Commit & Push to GitHub**:
   - Run `git add` and `git commit`.
   - Run `git push origin main` with `BypassSandbox: true`.
7. **Update This File**: Always record the changes, new question counts, and features in this document (`PROJECT_STATE.md`) automatically before finishing your turn.
